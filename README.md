## Before we start

This is a note of a 2D library in Golang - Pixel!  

Ocassionaaly I saw this library on the forum. After a short study, I found it pretty interesting, so I decided to record the knowledges for me and for every one, from a first-time learner's understanding.  

This tutorial has nothing to do with professional things. It is instead a quick "dictionary" of the authoritized tutorial. If you think something's wrong in mine, please check professional explainations and, tell me about it please.  

By the way, I failed to found neither authoritized nor self-made translation in Chinese, so my notes are written in English too. maybe I'll write a Chinese version in the future, but who knows?
