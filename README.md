# <center>Notes-of-Pixel</center>
This is a note of a 2D library in Golang - Pixel!  

Ocassionaaly I saw this library on the forum. After a short study, I found it pretty interesting, so I decided to record the knowledges for me and for every one, from a first-time learner's understanding.  

By the way, I failed to found neither authorized nor self-made translation in Chinese, so my notes are written in English too. maybe I'll write a Chinese version in the future, but who knows?
